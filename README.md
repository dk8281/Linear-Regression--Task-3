# Linear-Regression--Task-3
# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction - Linear Regression

This project is part of the AI & ML Internship (Task 3), where the goal is to understand and implement **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression** using a housing dataset.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Predict **house prices** based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, furnishing status, etc.
- Learn how to preprocess data, build regression models, and evaluate their performance.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Dataset: `Housing.csv` (from Kaggle)
- Contains features like `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `furnishingstatus`, etc.

---

## 🔧 Steps Performed

1. **Loaded the dataset** and explored the structure.
2. **Handled categorical variables** using One-Hot Encoding.
3. **Checked and treated outliers** in key numeric columns.
4. Built:
   - ✅ **Simple Linear Regression** model (using only `area`).
   - ✅ **Multiple Linear Regression** model (using all features).
5. **Split data** into train/test sets (80/20).
6. **Trained and evaluated** the models using:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   - R² Score
7. **Visualized**:
   - Regression line (simple)
   - Actual vs Predicted prices (multiple)
   - Residual plot
